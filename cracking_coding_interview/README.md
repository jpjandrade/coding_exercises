This folder contains my solutions for the problems in the [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=RJKD1EHC2Q3R7YVYPE8Z) book. These were solved and written with pen and paper and then copied to a python script to check for bugs and testing. They are not supposed to represent "production quality" code but what I could come up with in a concise version that solved the problem well. Corrections were only made if testing would error out or something.

These are not guaranteed to be useful for anyone but if you find a mistake please let me know :-D
