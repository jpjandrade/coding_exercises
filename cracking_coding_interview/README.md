This folder contains my solutions for the problems in the [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=RJKD1EHC2Q3R7YVYPE8Z) book. These were solved in pen and paper, tested in pen and paper and then written in (actual) python to check for bugs and testing. They are not supposed to represent "production quality" code but what I came up with as concise solutions. Corrections were only made if testing would error out or something.

These are not guaranteed to be useful to anyone but if you find a mistake please let me know :-D.
