This repo is mostly me reimplementing Java code (including solutions) from Cracking the Coding Interview, with the objective of learning a bit more of Java. 
Of all the useless folders is the whole repo, I'd say this is the most useless of them all :-P

Also, I have no idea how do organize .java files, i.e., how to contain the classes and how to bundle random functions.
Any tips are appreciated :-D
