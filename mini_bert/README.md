This folder contains a mini BERT implementation as described in [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book1/15/bert_torch.ipynb#scrollTo=0OJenK-mMh1m).

Very little of the code here is original, I just chopped into different files and bundled better the methods into their respective classes. It was done for my own education. I can strongly recommend you to do the same :).
