This folder contains my solutions for the exercises in the excellent [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-Scala-Paul-Chiusano/dp/1617290653/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1538946390&sr=8-1&keywords=functional+programming+scala) book, not to be confused with the [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala) Coursera specialization, for which I also have a [repository](https://github.com/jpjandrade/functional_programming_scala_specialization) (namespaces are one honking great idea!). 

Most of the exercises were solved without help, but some I had to look up and the answer, and I do a honor code style and point that out in the exercise.

Scala is fun y'all! :-D
